  "description": "Mutual' by Moodsoup investigates the concept of (non-)duality, visualised by a triptych of interdependent outputs.\n\nThis generative artwork consists of three distinct visual representations sharing a connection to a primary framework from which they cannot be detached. Although separate manifestations seem to exist, they all emerge from a common fundamental substrate. They are not disparate but are anchored to the same underlying structure."
