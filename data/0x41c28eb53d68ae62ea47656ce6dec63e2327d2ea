  "description": "**The On-Chain Art Revolution Is Here!**\n\nMeet Avatizer, the innovative generative art project that leverages on-chain technology to generate beautiful pieces of art totally independently from external servers or outside scripts. \n\nEach Avatizer NFT is a Mint Pass for ALL future project collections, mostly free to mint (the next one is already announced - it's Ugly Faces by Vitaliy Lishko). At the same time, each Avatizer represents a daily changing PFP based on the initial sketch by Andreas Pries - probably, it is the only dynamic generative art Mint Pass in the NFT world!\n\nThe Avatizer project was created by Roman Kropachek from the US-based software corporation Electronic Team, Inc. Each projectâ€™s collection is made in cooperation with famous artists and designers and has unique art and style.\n\nNOTE: OpenSea takes some time to cache the NFTs once the faces are reloaded. If your NFT takes too long to update, try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the listing.",
