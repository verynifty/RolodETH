  "description": "Little has been known about Badam Bomb until now. Badam has a frown with one gold tooth. He appears to be the opposite of Adam Bomb -- too cool, unfriendly and unapproachable. But, what if he wasn't? What if he wasn't bad, evil, or nefarious? What if he was just misunderstood? Explore Badam Bomb Squad, a collection of 5,000 NFTs that tell a story of how society often misreads and misconstrues one another through a series of traits and characteristics. Sometimes the only difference between you and your enemy is the way your ideas are dressed."
