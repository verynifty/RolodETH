  "description": "An on-chain, generative, multiplayer NFT-game by artist **Paul Seidler** (terra0) on Ethereum and [Optimism](https://opensea.io/collection/straylight-protocol-optimism) networks ~ presented by [folia](https://folia.app)  \n\nIn Straylight, players mint NFT-turmite “agents” that can move in over ~60,000 [patterns](https://straylight.folia.app/patterns) in shared worlds rendered and computed entirely on-chain. It is an expression of **on-chain maximalism**: meaning state, computation and graphics are stored, executed and generated by the contract.\n\nStraylight is deployed on both Ethereum mainnet and Optimism, providing not only a limited mainnet edition for collectors but also an optimal low-cost environment on L2 for playing with the protocol itself long into the future.\n\n[~ straylight.folia.app](https://straylight.folia.app)"
