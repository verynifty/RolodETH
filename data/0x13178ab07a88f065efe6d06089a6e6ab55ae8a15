While these token may possibly be exchanged with other parties for monetary or non-monetary compensation, there should be no reasonable expectation of profit from holding them. The Issuer of these IOUs makes no claims or guarantees that they will be redeemable for an asset or service of any kind at a later date. In no event shall the Issuer be held liable for any damages arising from holding an IOU. The Issuer reserves the right to revoke any IOU, change its thumbnail, name, or description, and issue new IOUs at their sole discretion."
