  "description": "With the Veil between our world and all things magical mysteriously shattered, it is up to you to become a powerful enough Caster to fight the menacing Indrid Cold and his powerful Cryptids….or join their ranks! Will you form a Contract with the benevolent Bigfoot and Fearsome Critters to protect our forests, or embrace the flying catastrophe that is The Mothman? The choice is yours in MetaZoo: Cryptid Nation!\n\nThis collection features 6 unique tokens which are the currency in the MetaZoo lore, each of which is representative of a special item or character in the MetaZoo universe.
