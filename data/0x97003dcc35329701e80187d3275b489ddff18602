  "description": "Honoring the long tradition of the vanitas genre, which has survived until todayâ€™s digital era, this collection consists of one hundred unique compositions, studies of color and treatments of form. The workflow that was carried out for this result is, in a way, a generative assembly, but done by hand by selecting elements from a library of personal assets that I have refined throughout the last 10 years in my digital praxis."
