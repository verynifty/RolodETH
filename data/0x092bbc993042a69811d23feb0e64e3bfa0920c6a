  "description": "In order to continue GCG’s path to dominance in the autonomous zone and metaverse, Gang leadership tasked top scientists to expand the population of the Gutter by cloning existing inhabitants. The scientists collected DNA samples from every member of Gutter City and created “Gutter Juice” vials to be used in a “Clone Machine” that will spit out android versions of the Gang - Gutter Clones."
