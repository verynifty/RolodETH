  "description": "Eternal Fragments is a collection of 2,828 generative art pieces, fully determined by the mint transaction and rendered in 3D post-mint using recursive mathematics. \n\n# Utility\n\nEternal Fragments is Part 1 of Spectra Art's Dawn Trilogy. \n\nCollectors of the Dawn Trilogoy will be able to claim a Dawn Key and get exclusive benefits including presale access and discounts to future [Spectra.Art](https://spectra.art) projects.\n\n# About the Project\n\nThe 3D generative algorithm renders fractal-like geometries and volumetric lighting to express the mintâ€™s transaction hash. The result demonstrates the chaos and order that simultaneously arise from recursive mathematical rules.\n\nRarity rankings: https://www.eternal-fragments.art/#/rarity\n\nAbout Spectra: https://www.spectra.art",
