  "description": "Omnimorphs are mimetic mysterious entities on Earth able to merge and evolve through [OmniFusion](https://fusion.omnimorphs.com). The Fusion utility gives owners the opportunity to combine two of their Omnimorph NFTs customizing the look & rarity of their avatar. The NFT collection was originally made of 10,000 hand-crafted artworks created by digital artist,  [Dániel Taylor](https://twitter.com/DanielTaylorArt). Owners receive a [Soul Shard](https://opensea.io/collection/omni-fusion) in exchange for one of their NFTs used in the Fusion. \n\n**Our vision is to create a supportive and curious NFT art collective where real value overcomes hype and excellence subdues glitz.**\n\nRead about [our Vision](https://omnimorphs.medium.com/omnimorphs-our-vision-for-2022-f210d0e0886b).\n\nLore, webshop, and more on our [website](https://omnimorphs.com)."
