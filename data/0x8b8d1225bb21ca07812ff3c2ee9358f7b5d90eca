One lucky minter will randomly receive the 1/1 rare cat that entitles them to a 1/1 original KidSuper design. Both the digital and physical items are exclusive to this Capsule Collection and will never be sold again.\n\nAdditionally, each NFT extends further opportunity for access to PUMA's web3 future experiences and ecosystem, as well as first access to upcoming Web3 activities from KidSuper.\n\nIf you are not a Genesis Collection member yet, view our main collection here: https://www.opensea.io/collection/catbloxgenesis"
