  "description": "Fourteenth Century Series is 201 unique images; still frames from an ancient and prophetic short film.\n\nThe artwork was created by capturing in-camera lighting that interacts with the immediate landscape. \nIt is experienced using blockchain technology and augmented reality on the walls of your own home.\n\nAlong with the digital artwork, owners will have the opportunity to acquire the physical print, \naugmented reality features, and membership into the Fourteenth Century Community.\n\nProceeds from this project (40%) will go towards creating The Fourteenth Century Fund, a fund focused on investing in blockchain projects that drive innovation, sustainability, and futurism.\n\nAs the Fourteenth Century Fund grows, owners of Reuben Wu artworks will be invited to join the #FCS community to help us shape the future by voting on the projects that the fund invests in.",
