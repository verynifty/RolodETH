  "description": "Hello 👋. I go by Animal. I enjoy painting and creating digital art and have been doing so for the past 12 years. My art is obscure and even strange at times. I am also an aspiring writer! Animal editions are short stories with acts, scenes, and characters. Collecting characters gives you the first right to purchase new scenes with your character 24 hours after drop. After 24 hours any remaining scenes will be listed for the public. 24 hours after public sale any remaining editions will be burned.  I hope you like my art and stories as this is my first NFT collection."
