  "description": "Cel Mates is a collection of 4207 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, created by the illustrator and artist mcbess. Each Cel Mate is an inmate of the Steel Hose Penitentiary, a fictional online world but a very real web3 media workshop. Owning a Cel Mate gives you access to visual art, music and community benefits in the members-only digital prison, which is a space for a counter-culture syndicate of creatives to hang out, learn, share and collaborate with like-minded creators."
