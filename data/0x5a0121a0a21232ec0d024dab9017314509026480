  "description": "[finiliar](https://finiliar.com) are living NFTs that use oracles to respond to fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies. They become happy and buoyant when the currency they are linked to does well, and sad or even sick when it performs poorly.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** All the eggs will hatch once the main sale is complete and reveal an idle finiliar. Following the hatch and idle state reveal, the team will work on animating the additional states so that every finiliar can express the full spectrum of emotions depending on the coin it represents."
