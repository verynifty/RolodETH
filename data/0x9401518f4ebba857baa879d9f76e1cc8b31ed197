  "description": "\"We are the ghosts, your nightmare, your daydream.\"\n\nWeirdo Ghost Gang is a collection of 5555 Lil Ghosts roaming in the web3 playground together with countless frens. Lil Ghosts are not just avatars, but also the duke of a castle, the manager of a street brand, a super rapper, a virtual idol, and the protagonist of an adventure...only the boundary of imagination can limit our pace, our existence is not only in the metaverse but will eventually penetrate the reality.\n\n👻[Twitter](https://twitter.com/WeirdoGhostGang) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/weirdoghost) | [Website](https://www.weirdoghost.com/) 👻\n\n\n*Tip: You can check whether a Lil Ghost has claimed [WGG Haunted House](https://opensea.io/collection/wgg-haunted-house) in [Gallery](https://www.weirdoghost.com/gallery) by searching the token number.\n"
