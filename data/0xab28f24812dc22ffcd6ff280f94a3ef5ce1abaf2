  "description": "In the near future, as part of an experiment – 10,000 Apes on the Ethereum blockchain were exposed to a super ape serum which transmogrified them into 6969 CHAD Apes with super-ape capabilities.\n\nThe remaining 3031 Apes had an adverse reaction to the super-ape serum which turned them into vicious monsters. These Monster Apes are now wandering the Ethereum blockchain and thus threatening the very existence of Ethereum blockchain if not captured & cured with the help of an anti-dote."
