  "description": "(🥚,🐔) LUSD Chicken Bonds: **a DeFi protocol paired with a generative NFT collection**\r\n\r\nWhen users deposit LUSD into the Chicken Bonds, they receive an Egg-NFT that contains the claim upon the assets. It can be transferred or resold.\r\n\r\nThe Egg-NFT features three randomized attributes (Border, Card, Egg Color) and one attribute scaling with the amount of LUSD deposited (Egg Size).\r\n\r\nThe NFT evolves with the users' interaction with the app: Chicken Bonds pioneers **Dynamic NFTs**. \r\n\r\nWhen they confirm or cancel the bond, their Egg-NFT **evolves** into a Chad Chicken or Scared Chicken and gains additional generative attributes. **Depending on the wallet onchain activities, the user can obtain more attributes**: if the wallet owns a Liquity trove, or LQTY (staked too), or voted for the LUSD/3pool Curve gauge.\r\n\r\nThe art for the LUSD Chicken Bonds NFT lives fully onchain (.svg approach) and was made by Luchador, creator of the eponym collection.\r\n\r\nhttps://chickenbonds.org/"
