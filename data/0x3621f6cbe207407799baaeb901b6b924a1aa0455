  "description": "Pastel World is a collection of 8,888 legendary Pastel Prophet NFTs— one-of-a-kind digital collectibles residing on the Ethereum blockchain… for now. The Pastel Prophets are gifted people from the PASTEL GALAXY, a cluster of planets and stars many light years away. Tragically, their home planet was destroyed and they were forced to roam deep space in search of a perfect planet to populate. After hundreds of years searching aboard their starship, they found PASTEL WORLD. Could this be their new home to evolve their race?",
