  "description": "LCD 1 is a device for ASCII art.  \n1 token = 1 device.  \nOwners of the token will be able to claim a physical device with the corresponding edition number (the edition number is fused permanently in the hardware of LCD 1).  \nOnce claimed the state of the token will change from ‘unlcaimed’ to ‘claimed’, this state can’t be reversed.  \nThe media associated to the token acts also as a terminal: it can stream the visual content of the physical device to a computer screen.
