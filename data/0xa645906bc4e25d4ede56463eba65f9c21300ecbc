  "description": "In 1967, Donald Silverstein had an epic photoshoot with musician Jimi Hendrix.\n\nDonald and Jimi only met once, but their connection was special, and the original image featured in this piece is a wonderful representation of that.\n\nA single image of Donald and Jimi touching foreheads has been broken up into 101 customised puzzle shapes. There are 6 different shapes with various rarities.\n\nThe customised puzzle pieces are presented within the original negative border frame of the image.\n--------------------  \nOriginal photograph Â© Donald Silverstein / The Silverstein Family Estate.
