  "description": "A token that represents governance over the Founder’s DAO, which was seeded with a mix of Pixel Vault assets, NFTs from other projects, and 1/1 artwork by artists such as Hackatao, Fvckrender, and Killer Acid. There are 5,902 Founder’s DAO tokens, each of which serve as one vote for DAO decisions. Tokens were created through a “burn” decision from holders of PUNKS Comic Issue #1, and that window is now closed."
