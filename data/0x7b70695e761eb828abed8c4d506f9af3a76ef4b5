  "description": "ZenAcademy is a community for all where all are welcome. We seek to be your home in the metaverse. A humble abode where we have a passion for education and learning that is grounded in logic and reason. Whether you’re just starting out, whether you’re an artist, a dev, project founder, or a self professed degen.\n\nWe’re here for you; we’re here for everyone.\n\nYour ZenChest is your membership to ZenAcademy and its future PFP project. \n\nBy owning a ZenChest, you have access to everything that the [original Genesis letter](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xf64e6fb725f04042b5197e2529b84be4a925902c/1) afforded you, including the exclusive ZenAcademy Discord channels, community giveaways, and the future ZenAcademy PFP project. Each ZenChest grants you the ability to summon 1 PFP.  Your PFP lies dormant in your chest, waiting to be summoned."
