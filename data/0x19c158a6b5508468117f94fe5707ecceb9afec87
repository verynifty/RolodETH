  "description": "DAO House was built to establish IRL members clubs for Web3 degens. These hubs of culture, connected through the common bond of delicious cocktails and degenerate JPEG-buying behaviour will serve as gathering places to foster innovation in crypto and art, as well as introduce people to their new favourite martini (and maybe the future of the internet.)\n\nAlso core to this mission is onboarding amazing artists who have yet to discover web3 as well as those who want to join the party but live outside major cities with DAO Houses. To provide a more inclusive DH experience, we’re thrilled to announce the DAO House Friends PFP, a virtual membership to DH."
