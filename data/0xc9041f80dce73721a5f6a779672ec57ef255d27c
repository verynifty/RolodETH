  "description": "The Skulls of Luci are a gift to the collectors, collaborators, & each individual who placed an offer on my genesis series: LUCI Chapter 1\n\nThere are 50 unique paintings, 49 can be seen here, but can also only be claimed by those individuals.\n\nOne remains: the origin point which each skull is based on: The Blueprint Skull on SuperRare.\n\nThe Partition is formed … End Chapter 1 … These former husks / Vessels adorned with ancestry / Carry the code / Of shared memory // Though flayed and quartered / The bone is porous / Fertile grounds / Ripe for the return // New flesh grows / Once we learn how to die / Souls for the bankless / The tree decides // Power sown in urns and ashes / Eternity learned / in collective demise."
