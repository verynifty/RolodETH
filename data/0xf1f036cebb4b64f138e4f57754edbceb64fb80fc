  "description": "Live sale: https://metaverse.sothebys.com/salgado\n\nSotheby’s is pleased to present, Sebastião Salgado: Amazônia, the debut NFT collection from one of the world’s most celebrated living photographers. Masterfully crafted over the course of five months, Amazônia is composed of a collection of 5,000 unique photographs and Tree of Life, an original short video film with original audio as a 1/1. The collection spans more than a decade of Salgado’s visits through the Amazon. Among the 5,000 photographs there are 10 categories coupled with numerous traits representing the location, region, and villages Sebastião Salgado immortalized through these journeys. \n\nAmazônia is both a love letter to and a call to action to support the extraordinary beauty of the region's rainforest, rivers, mountains, and people. Primary sale and secondary royalties' proceeds are to benefit Institut Terra, a non-profit organization cofounded in 1998 by Sebastião Salgado and Lélia Deluiz Wanick Salgado."
