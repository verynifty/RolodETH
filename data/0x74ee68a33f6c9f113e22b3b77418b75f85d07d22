  "description": "Zerion Genesis Collection, 2021. The Genesis Collection was designed in collaboration with Nikolay Ironov, an AI artist created by the design studio Art. Lebedev.\nEach card displays a novel representation of Zerion’s logo – a metaphor for the myriad ways in which DeFi, and Web3 in general, can be valuable to the people who use it.\nThis limited-edition series accompanies Zerion’s first support of NFTs, allowing anyone to view their digital collectibles alongside their decentralized finance (DeFi) assets.\nThe evolution of decentralized finance and web 3.0 is one in which the lines between money, debt, ownership and creative works are ultimately blurred. The narrative underlying this series is that the new economy is open to anyone – and technology aids how we define this."
