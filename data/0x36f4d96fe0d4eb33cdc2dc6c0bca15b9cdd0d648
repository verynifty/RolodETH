  "description": "The gmDAO is a community of NFT collectors, artists & investors created on September 2021 using a fair token distribution. The DAO was formed based on the principles of etiquette and mutual respect, making our community a haven within a typically hostile environment. \n\nThe DAO consists of members who are active within the NFT sector, with backgrounds ranging from accredited investors to renowned generative artists. Our primary goal is to foster & encourage the development of the NFT space.\n\nThe gm. token is our native governance token with artwork designed by legendary gen artist Rich Poole. These tokens entitle their owner to participate in the governance of the gmDAO, as well as granting additional benefits relating to ventures created by the DAO.",
