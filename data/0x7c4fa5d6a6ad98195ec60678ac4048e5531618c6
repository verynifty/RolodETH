  "description": "The Bored Breakfast Club consists of 5,000 unique breakfast scenes, living as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. They also grant you access to an exclusive coffee club that ships insanely-delicious coffee from third-wave roasters Yes Plz, for FREE worldwide. Each NFT is sized to fit perfectly as a banner in your social network of choice.  \n\nHolders will also benefit from a Community Coffee Wallet that funds ongoing coffee shipments via royalties on secondary market sales and a portion of profits from Bored Breakfastâ€™s eCommerce sales. In essence, Bored Breakfast Club is Web3 Coffee Subscription service.",
