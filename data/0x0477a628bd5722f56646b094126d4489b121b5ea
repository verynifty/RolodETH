  "description": "Slices of TIME is a two-part collection, inspired by TIME’s nearly 100 year history. \nCollectors determined the collection’s rarity at every step by participating in a 10-day burn period, which ended at 12pm ET on Feb 23, 2022.\n\nSlices of TIME features nearly 4,000 TIME covers from the past century. Every year since Henry Luce and Britton Hadden founded TIME in 1923 is represented in 99 original artworks, produced by TIME Creative Director D.W.
