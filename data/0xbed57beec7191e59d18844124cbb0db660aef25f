  "description": "Yat Magic Mirror Gems were created to celebrate the defining moments in the Web 3 age. Each Gem is a remarkable event in NFT or DeFi history that propelled the space forward and moved the culture in a significant way. The Gems tell a story that otherwise would have remained hidden, lost, or hard to tell. Thankfully the Gems elevate these on-chain stories through the universal language of emojis with beautifully crafted video NFTs. These stories are your stories, they’re our stories, they’re our shared Web 3 culture and may you cherish your Gems for future generations to come."
