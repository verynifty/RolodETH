  "description": "American singer that was recognized by Akon\nLamar Jr grew up in a black ghetto. Life never treated this young man with kindness. While he did not receive much love, he was willing to give love, caring about society and his family. He's inspired by R&B, Inspirational and dance music - genres that help uplift people's spirits. Seeing people smile and filled with positive energy is what drives him to create music that builds hope, excitement and joy."
