  "description": "Pineapples and Melons (PaMs) Original is an exclusive collection of 1,111 mint pass NFTs by Original Legacy that will grant holders access to all future artist drawn collections, each with their own utility/roadmap.\n\nPaMs Original is also a story-driven NFT project where community members will play a role in how the story unfolds. Your NFT character will be featured in the storyline and periodic animated shorts will also be released at pivotal points in the story. The vision is that this will not only become our story, but also YOUR story as well."
