  "description": "SSX3LAU is a collaboration between DJ 3LAU, aka Justin Blau, and visual artist Slime Sunday. 3LAU began releasing mashups in 2011 and began growing a following through these YouTube releases. From 2012-2015, he began touring and putting out several singles. His career blew up and has led to hundreds of millions of streams and appearances at EDC Vegas, Electric Zoo, Lollapalooza, and more. Slime Sunday is the artistic project created by Mike Parisella. Mike's uber surreal artwork has amassed him a following of over half a million on Instagram. While it may not show on his Instagram which primarily features still artworks, Mike is an expert in creating animations - this is clearly seen through the brilliance of SSX3LAU."
