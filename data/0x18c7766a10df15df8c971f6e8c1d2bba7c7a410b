Our randomized NFT collection contains 7,777 unique robot avatars—these designs have narrative significance within our project’s lore. This lore introduces an expansive fictional universe which will serve as the basis for future stories, characters, and art, all woven across different forms of media. Your robot avatar is your ticket into the greater Vogu Metaverse—giving you exclusive access to stories, assets, and collabs.\r\n\r\nCheck out our other collections:\r\nGenesis collection : https://opensea.io/collection/vogu-collection\r\nMutts companion collection: https://opensea.io/collection/the-vogu-mutts"
