  "description": "Queens+Kings overthrow hierarchies in contemporary art and re-mint your CryptoRealm:\nCreated by Hackatao and NFT Studios, supported by Sotheby’s\n\n6,900 Queens+Kings: interchangeable NFT traits, randomly allocated and algorithmically generated. The avatars can then be hacked by the collectors, customized, disassembled and assembled on the [dedicated website](http://queenskings.hackatao.com) builder. In the cryptoverse, a non-hierarchical community is in charge, traditional roles of the art world are subverted.  Hack the Royals, let the Self-Crowning begin.  "
