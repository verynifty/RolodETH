  "description": "What happens when a group of apes working in a bakery gets pissed on by birds putting out a fire set by potatoes? Caked Apes happen. They are 8888 unique orphaned NFTs that need a home. Won't you please consider taking some Caked Apes home before they spoil?\n\n[cakedapes.com](https://cakedapes.com)"
