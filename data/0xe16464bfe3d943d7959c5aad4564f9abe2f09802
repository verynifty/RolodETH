  "description": "Every city is a woman like you, like me, like us.\n\nThis collection is inspired by the beautiful novel Invisible Cities written by Italo Calvino. It is the confluence of my own creative concerns turned into images. With this series of portraits, I intend to explore the idea of cities represented by the female figure in its multiplicity of beings. \n",
