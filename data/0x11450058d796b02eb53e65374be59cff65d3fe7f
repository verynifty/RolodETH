  "description": "SHIBOSHIS are 10,000 lovable Shiba Inu generated Non Fungible Tokens (NFTS) eternally written on the Ethereum blockchain. These Shibs have varying traits that make each unique and collectible (for instance Laser Eyes or Party Hat). Furthermore, each trait corresponds to an enhancement of the base ShibaStrength of the Shiboshi in our upcoming Shiboshi Game. You’ll be able to purchase, and trade these SHIBOSHIS here and at ShibaSwap without fees. These are the official SHIBOSHIS of the Shiba Inu decentralized community as seen on Forbes, Wall St. Journal, Fortune, CNN, MSNBC and just about everywhere else. Beware of scams."
