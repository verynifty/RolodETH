  "description": "NOTE TO BUYERS: Voyagers was not a randomly generated collection. Users chose their traits at mint. Because of this, some tokens are duplicates - particularly tokens that were minted by bots. Voyagers are customizable NFTs. You will be able to change the look of your token with traits you earn and collect. Don't worry if your token is a duplicate or if you want other traits. You will be able to build the Voyager that you want! We will do periodic trait releases via game mechanics, the trait shop, and airdrops.\n\nBuild, explore, collect, trade, research, and fight as you establish civilization across the Stargarden Galaxy."
