  "description": "RELI3F is a web3 initiative to provide global humanitarian aid. our first collection is in support of the people of Ukraine, and includes 37 of our space's most influential artists, some of whom call Ukraine home. We recognize the Ukrainian people's struggle. In a crisis where time is of the essence, web3 allows us to collaborate with artists + collectors to get funds where they are most needed. And because of the blockchain, we can provide full transparency.\r\n\r\n100% of the primary sale will go towards relief efforts in Ukraine. All royalties from secondary sales will either go towards those same efforts, or towards supporting Ukrainian artists, charity, and/or art initiatives of the participating artist’s choice."
