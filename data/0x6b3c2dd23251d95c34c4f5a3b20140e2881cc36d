  "description": "Meet your lifelong companion and powerful ally: The Wanderer. Your pet and its in-game abilities can evolve. Right now every Wanderer is a pup who will give their owners a carry weight bonus in the Realms of Ethernity game.\n\nBut the Wanderer story is just beginning. Itâ€™s best not to forget that these adorable pups come from a species that once laid waste to civilization. \n\nRaise them well. Our closest allies can turn to devastating foes.\n\nFollow the growth of Wanderers on Twitter (@roemmorpg) to take your pet on interactive adventures and earn unique traits and abilities.",
