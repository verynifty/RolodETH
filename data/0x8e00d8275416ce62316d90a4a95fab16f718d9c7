  "description": "\"But That's So Far Away\" is a selection of 50 photos I've created throughout the past decade. Taken with a variety of cameras and techniques at different points of my life, these photographs tell a story of long distance telephone, through a paper cup. The collection draws inspiration from internet meme culture and popular icons such as SpongeBob SquarePants. \"But That's So Far Away\"  is a wild expression of hedonistic joy, self-deprecating humor, performance art, and sex positivity.\n\n\nAll photos in this series are 1/1, minted and smart contracted with Manifold. 3000px on the long side for every photo."
