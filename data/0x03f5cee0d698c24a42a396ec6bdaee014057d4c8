Each team will battle against all others every month in a March Madness style tournament.\n\nFor the first time in centuries, owning your own sports team is not for the ultra-wealthy. This is the start of a brand new worldwide sporting league.\n\nEach month a new tournament starts and the winners of each monthly tournament will be showered in prizes from the community pool.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/rbBqVu4Bqu\n\nWebsite: https://www.nfteams.club/\n\nRarity Ranking: https://www.nfteams.club/rarity"
