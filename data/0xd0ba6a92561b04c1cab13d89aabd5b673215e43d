  "description": "3027 AD. An evil regime has taken over the known world. Everything changed when a great force was released by the attack brought upon by the New Order. Orbs of great power were dispersed across the world. Only 7,777 chosen warriors have gathered to be on a mission to obtain the orbs and use it to fight back in the hopes of regaining what was lost. Their heroism has been kept for their tales to be passed on. \n\nThis is the story of SoulZ."
