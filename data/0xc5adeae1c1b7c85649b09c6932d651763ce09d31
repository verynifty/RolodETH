  "description": "\"Zibaldone: Excerpts from a codex of possibilities\" is a collection of 200, 1/1 pieces.\n\nThe collection uses a generative system of asemic glyphs as the seed for the artist to build on.\n\nThe generative system and the artist are collaborators, responding in turn to each other's moves."
