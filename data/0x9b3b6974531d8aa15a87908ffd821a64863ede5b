  "description": "In the TriVerse, three possible alternate realities form three different realms converged and connected by the Nexus Gateway, where beings from each realm can travel to the other three realms.\n\nNever stable and always fighting to be the only realm, each realm has a Sentience represented by the collective beings in their respective realms. It is said that one day, when one of these Sentience grow strong enough, they will merge the weaker realms into one unified plane of existence.\n\nWho wins, who loses, which realm triumph depends on you."
