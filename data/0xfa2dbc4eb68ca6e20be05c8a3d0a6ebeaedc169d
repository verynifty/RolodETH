  "description": "A collection of 15,000 huggable, collectible artwork by Lisa Chow, of which only 6,000 is available presently. A HUG Pass allows you to access the HUGhub community DYOR and discovery platform for NFTs, made available through a private Discord. Each hug comes with its own perk, which is only unlocked when matched.\n\nMinting is done in multiple waves to onboard new people into the HUGhub community in a manageable way that allows early members to participate in determining content, contributing research/curation, and sharing their favorite NFT collections, while also getting to know their fellow HUGgers. Wave 1 of minting is now complete, with future minting windows to be determined with input from the community.\n\nFor more information, follow @thehugxyz on Twitter or visit https://thehug.xyz."
