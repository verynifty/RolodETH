  "description": "OWNER COUNT and TRADED VOLUME: Currently, the owners statistic and traded volume shown by OpenSea are inaccurate for this collection. The real number including staked Rollbots is over 3k and majority of Rollbot trades happen on https://rollbot.com/\n\nA collection of 10,000 unique robots generated algorithmically using over 180 traits with proof of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain and a focus on utility. Inspired by projects like Aavegotchi and CryptoPunks, Rollbots are based on the ERC-721 standard that underlies most digital collectible and utility projects.\n\nEach Rollbot is a Pixar-style piece of digital art that doubles up as a personalised VIP membership card like you’d get at a regular casino. Become a Rollbit VIP by owning a Rollbot and enjoy the perks, which multiply if you own more than one!"
