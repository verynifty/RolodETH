  "description": "STATE OF THE ART is the first large scale hybrid collection by ThankYouX. This project reimagines the use of blockchain technology as a medium rather than a tool for distribution. The collection consists of four large scale paintings broken up into 400 tiles eachâ€” creating 1600 total unique digital artworks that come paired with their physical counterpart. Upon mint, participants will randomly receive a singular digital tile corresponding with a section of one of the four paintings. Later, collectors will be able to claim the identical physical artwork."
