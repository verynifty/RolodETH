  "description": "“…the box was a fascist symbol and the architecture of freedom/democracy needed something besides the box.” - Frank Lloyd Wright.    Freeplan explores the early 20th-century modernist architectural concept “open plan” which indicates the dissolution of rooms and the visual building boundaries. Instead of conventional boxes, freely placed partitions, floors, structures, and other elements create a feeling of space. The transaction hash determines the overall architectural composition, context, existence of components, and representation style. Each iteration is scaled, oriented, and numbered like a proper architectural project."
