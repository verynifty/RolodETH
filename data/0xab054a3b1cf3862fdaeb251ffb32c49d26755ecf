  "description": "The year is 8,888, the Great Pengu War are almost over but at a great cost. All original penguins minds are gone or missing. One small faction, the V's, couldn't stand doing nothing and decided to save and protect all Penguins. By sacrificing their own Penguinity and with the blessing of the Mythic Bullwhale, they became one with the machines and created legendary weaponry.\r\n\r\n13,332 Mecha Penguins, armored for battle are here!"
