  "description": "Rumor has it that those who hold a Slice of Heaven will be Blessed for all Eternity.. “SLICE OF HEAVEN” is a generative series in which scenes from heaven are fused with Beeple’s exceptional #Everyday works.\r\n\r\nThe main generation of this collection use GAN modeling. I’ve been playing with this technique since 2018, and I’ve used it in dozens of works during that time. Striking the right balance of unpredictability and quality is a difficult challenge for even the best generative artists in this field. The technique corrupts the initial images by progressively adding Gaussian noise. Neural networks reverse the corruption process. Running this reversed corruption process synthesizes data from pure noise by gradually denoising it until a clean heavenscape is produced.\r\n\r\nBEEBLE WORLD: https://opensea.io/collection/beeble-world/\r\nGenesis OS: https://opensea.io/collection/beeble-genesis\r\nHellfire OS: https://opensea.io/collection/hellfire-by-beeble",
