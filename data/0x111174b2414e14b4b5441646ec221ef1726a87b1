  "description": "Collision editions are distributed as free rewards to the Blokpax community .  Blokpax does not sell Collision editions. \n\nCollision is a multi-artist collaboration where every art edition is tied to a physical artifact.  \n\nOur physical artifacts will be auctioned for BPX, our future ecosystem utility token.  This BPX will then be distributed to Collision edition holders on a pro-rata basis (who may then use the BPX themselves in future auctions or throughout our ecosystem).  \n\n\nIMPORTANT:  BPX has no functionality other than within the Blokpax ecosystem, and it cannot be purchased from Blokpax. Blokpax does not provide, or intend to provide, a secondary marketplace for BPX.",
