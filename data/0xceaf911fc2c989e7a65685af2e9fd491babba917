  "description": "1930 was one of the best eras for cartoons. Our Loomis are inspired by this 30’s art style aka “RUBBER HOSE STYLE” with typical 1930s floppy and funky looks. We wanted to bring that amazing art style back to life with a bit of artistic touch. All Loomis live in Loomi Land. They are known to befriend these creatures called SideKicks. Rumor has it SideKicks are the key to the future in this world. This is the next step in developing the world created by our founder/artist Rukshan AKA Coso."
