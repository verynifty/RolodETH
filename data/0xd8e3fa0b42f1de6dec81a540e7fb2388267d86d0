  "description": "**The Žena Dystrict is probably the most mysterious and confusing place of the known Oddyverse. It is a world of its own that shares the same space and runs parallel with another, it is often referred to more of an alternate dimension than a world.  It is a mystical place that a few beings have actually seen, but almost all have heard stories and myths about. Žena’s inherited a few powers from their ancestors but one they truly mastered was shapeshifting, though it is believed they stumbled onto this when entering into the Mirror Realm.**\n\n**[The Odd Dystrict Genesis Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/the-odd-dystrict-official)**"
