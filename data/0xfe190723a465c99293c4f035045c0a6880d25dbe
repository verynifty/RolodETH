They also get the possibility of minting up to three additional buds. Minters of the green pass will receive a free Decentraland Goat Jacket.\n\nThe main objective of Season One is to produce the Gen1 strains with the highest possible THC percentage, to stake it, and accumulate $HIGH.\n\nThe game starts by staking GEN0 buds and generating enough $HIGH so that breeding can begin."
