  "description": "Amateur art thieves and professional psychopaths Janky & Guggimon have broken into Christie’s NYC and jacked 22 ultra-rare and ridiculously valuable CryptoJanky NFTs. Unfortunately, Janky got cross-faded on the way to the job and accidentally set off a booby trap, leveling the Christie’s Auction House and blowing all the NFTs to bits! The drunken duo narrowly escaped the popo, hauling all the broken NFTs with them. Unwilling to give up their dream of getting Kanye rich — or at least copping enough cash for tequila, nuggs, and tix to Coachella — they’ve busted out the super-glue, huffed it, then recombined the broken bits into 9,240 totally unique CryptoJanky NFTs."
