  "description": "LobsterDAO is an OG collective of DeFi & NFT degens and whales. The community dates back to summer 2018, comprising most notable founders and researchers in the crypto scene. We were among the first to LP in Curve as well as other large protocols! \n\n*As such, some say, lobsterdao NFT is a badge of honour and IQ.*\n\nThe collection contains 6751 pieces done by [Klibansky](https://josephklibansky.com/news/lobsterdao-x-klibansky-nft). There is a DAO with a multisig and a working group that everyone can contribute to. [See all links & info](https://github.com/lobster-dao/overview). Our community is swimming in the [DeFi research chat](https://t.me/lobsters_chat), [general NFT chat](https://t.me/NFT_avenue), and its own:\n\n ðŸ¦ž [NFT-gated Seafood Kingdom telegram chat](https://telegram.me/collablandbot?start=VFBDI1RFTCNDT01NIy0xMDAxNTc3NzExMjQx) ðŸŒŠ",
