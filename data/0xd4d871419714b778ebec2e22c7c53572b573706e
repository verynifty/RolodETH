  "description": "Stoner Cats is an adult animated short series accessed exclusively by owning a collectible Stoner Cat NFTs. The NFT sales directly fund the mini-pilot and all future content. The show is centered around five house cats who mysteriously become sentient. With their higher consciousness, they realize that their beloved owner needs rescue from a myriad of dangerous situations. \r\n\r\nWith great _flower_ comes great responsibility."
