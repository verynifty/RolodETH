He has worked with renowned artists such as Chris Brown, Dua Lipa, Post Malone and has also worked with brands such as Vans, Marshall, Footlocker, KFC, Oppo and many more. \r\n\r\nJoining our community means more than just art, it also provides community-based exclusive access to many portals throughout our roadmap that you will be able to unlock as we move forward and we’re excited to see each and every one of you join our journey."
