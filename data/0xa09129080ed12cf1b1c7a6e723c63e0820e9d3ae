  "description": "The Ethereum Improvement Pandas & Bear Market Frens is a project inspired by the Merge meme where a black bear and a white bear merge into a panda bear.\n\nNot only are pandas a fun symbol for the Merge, but bears in general are also a great way to honor the eco-friendly nature of Ethereum as we switch to Proof of Stake, since much of their habitat has been destroyed.\n\nRoyalties from every sale go towards ManeNet DAO, which advances the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods, education and decentralization.",
