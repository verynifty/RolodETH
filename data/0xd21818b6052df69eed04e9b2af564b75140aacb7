  "description": "An Important Memory for Humanity is Refik Anadol’s groundbreaking limited-edition NFT collection that utilizes data from the world’s first all-civilian space flight. The collection presents a series of poetic data sculptures and paintings of the Inspiration4 mission. \r\n\t\r\nFor this collection, Anadol and his team interpreted data from SpaceX and NASA-funded research institute TRISH (Translational Research Institute for Space Health) on the effects of space travel on the human body. TRISH conducts cutting-edge research into the impact that the conditions in space have on the astronauts, with an attempt to reduce the health risks of venturing deeper into the universe.\r\n\r\nAnadol’s one-of-a-kind NFT collection not only reveals an insight into the challenges of space travel, but also contributes to a meaningful and purposeful cause to help solve critical health issues. 30% of all NFT sales will be donated to St Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\r\nIn collaboration with //CreativeWorkStudio."
