  "description": "Koin Games is a team of multi-decade game industry veterans, entrepreneurs, and blockchain natives on a mission to show the world how to bridge the gap between traditional and blockchain games.\n\nBlending years of blockchain experience with decades of award-winning game development, we bring a deep understanding of both traditional and web3 gaming audiences that nobody else in the gaming space has.\n\nBut we almost left out our most important team members: YOU!\nTraditional games are built “for the customers.” Web3 games are created “with the community.” At Koin Games, we understand that the community is the heart of any web3 product. Unlike traditional games that aren’t spoken about until just before they launch, we will build a series of industry-leading web3 games transparently and together with our community.\n\nOur genesis collection, the 5,555 Koin Games Dev Squad avatars, are the VIPs and OGs of our community and will enjoy first-class seats as they join us on this incredible journey.",
