They are all familiar to the darkness and its evil ways, they have sworn an oath to protect Exzidia at all cost, their rank and skill represented by the badge of honour they wear with pride on their suit\nLuca must lead this galactic fleet into the darkness to fight an evil Kozmonauts know only to well, they must defeat this dark entity and those who lurk in it only then can they restore order and life within Exzidias realm and in doing so allow the furs to return home safe and sound."
