  "description": "The Toy Boogers Special Edition series is an ongoing Ethereum based NFT airdrop collection for Toy Boogers holders. They are a special way to commemorate big events in the Toy Boogers history. Each Special Edition will be a single work of art with multiple editions. They will be named and numbered by the order in which we create and release them and can be viewed, collected, bought, and sold just like any other Ethereum NFT.\r\n\r\nThe original Toy Boogers collection is: https://opensea.io/collection/toyboogers"
