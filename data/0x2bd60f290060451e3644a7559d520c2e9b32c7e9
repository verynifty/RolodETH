We looked at birds with jealousy, and the stars with wonder. \n\nGRAYCRAFT2 brings us one step closer to our dreams. This is the first ever generative 3D spaceship project of its kind, a collection of 5,200 unique creations that represents the freedom, exploration and progress that is the spirit of this generation’s space entrepreneurs. \n\nWith GRAYCRAFT2, space becomes a universe of possibilities for everyone. \n\nEach GRAYCRAFT2 will also entitle you to claim 1 free mint from our upcoming GRAYCRAFT Mech collection.\n\n[Download the GC2 high resolutions photos & the 3D model](https://graycraft.com/gc2)\n\n[Discover the GRAYCRAFT1](https://opensea.io/collection/graycraft)\n\n[Discover GRAYCRAFT](https://graycraft.com)"
