  "description": "Untamed Elephants is in the history books as the first-ever charity-driven NFT community. Our goal is to save the elephants while spoiling collectors and building a great business. To date, our community has donated $75,000 to three close elephant non-profit partners (Save The Elephants, ECF, and Saving Ganesh). Other great milestones: going on a 2-week volunteer mission in Sri Lanka with NFT holders, creating a wine, and having legendary rockstar Peter Frampton rep our PFP.\n\nWe transparently donate 1/3rd of all secondary royalties to save African and Asian elephants around the world.\n\nJoin the Untamed Elephants by purchasing an NFT or simply dropping by our Discord (https://www.discord.com/invite/elephants).\n\nIn addition to Untamed Elephants, we recommend you buy at least one Untamed Matriarch to lead your herd. https://opensea.io/collection/untamed-matriarchs\n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/elephantnfts/\n\nWebsite: https://www.untamedelephants.io"
