  "description": "Randomly generated on-chain ascii text faces. All attributes and metadata are on-chain and easily viewable via the etherscan UI. The face generation algo was shut off after 10000 faces were minted. Project was launched in January 2020.\n\nSymmetry can be in one of 3 tiers: 0, 50%, 100%. If both eyes match and both face pieces match, the face will have 100% symmetry. If only one of those match, the face will have 50% symmetry.\nGolf Scores are an aggregate score of how rare each of the 5 face pieces are for a given face.\nPercent Bear is a score that gives 16 points for each bear piece, and then adds to a random number between 1 and 20.\nCombo score is calculated as: Percent Bear / Golf Score\n\ncreated by natealex"
