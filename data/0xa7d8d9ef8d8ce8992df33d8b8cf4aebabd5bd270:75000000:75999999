  "description": "Breathe You is an interpretation of the bond of love with another being, an unbroken circle full of light and color, together, still or spinning through this universe as time pushes forward with every shared breathe, in and out. Relax, stare, sync your breathing with the motion, become hypnotized and feel the love. This is the first work on Art Blocks to use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Chase Mints: Special versions may exist named Birth, Death, Rainbow or Golden. One or more might get minted or might not. Catch one if you can."
