  "description": "The Zodiac Capsule collection is a supplementary collection launched in November 2021 as a free mint to Capsule House holders. A Zodiac can either be minted from a Capsule whose Zodiac has been unclaimed or bought on the secondary market. In order to unlock the utility of the hatched Capsule profile picture, you must hold a capsule from the original Capsule House collection. There are no current plans for Zodiac Capsule profile pictures.",
