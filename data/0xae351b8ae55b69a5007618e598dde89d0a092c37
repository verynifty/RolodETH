  "description": "Claim is over. \n\nThe remaining claim passes are expired. \n\nIf you want to become a Lost Miner please purchase from our [official storefront.](https://opensea.io/collection/lostminers)\n\nThe Lost Miners from the unused claim passes are now The Forgottens. \n\nRead the [whitepaper](https://lostminers.xyz/whitepaper) to learn more.\n\n*Note: The unused claim passes remain tradable.  Their only utility is as a collectible.  You can look at the Lost Miners of the Ether collection to see which Forgotten miner each pass could have previously claimed. "
