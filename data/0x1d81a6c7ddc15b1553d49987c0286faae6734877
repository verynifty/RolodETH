  "description": "The Unusual Whales NFT Project. There are currently 6,969 Whales in this project, each one being unique in it's own way. No two are alike with some being rarer than others. \n\nHowever, this is not just another generative art project, but a pass to access NFT tools to help you navigating the NFT space. It also gives you access to the equity, options, crypto, and derivative tools at unusualwhales.com.\n\nHolding an NFT in your wallet will allow you to access the tools exclusively.\n\nAs a reminder, NFT prices are highly volatile, and often represent illiquid markets. These are not investment vehicles but rather access to the unusualwhales.com equity, options, and crypto tooling. Enter/purchase at your own risk and please be responsible. You can lose all or some of your initial crypto bid.",
