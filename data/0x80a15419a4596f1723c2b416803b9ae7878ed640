  "description": "Zenverse NFT  is the first outing of world-famous comic artist C. C. Tsai into the NFT sphere and is the first collection in ThezenDAO NFT series.  \nZenverse NFT drawing from classic images of traditional Zen masters, Tsai created 7777 paintings for NFT distribution.\nThe intention of Zenverse NFT is to use the Web3 world to transmit the culture of Zen.  Offerings that integrate Zen and Web3 will include The World of Zen NFT paintings and something we are calling cryptocurrency self-cultivation.  \nThe paintings in The World of Zen come in three styles: karmic figures, meditating figures, and masters (rare).  \nThe artistic style of each painting merges the tradition of comic illustration with classic Chinese ink-wash painting.  Each figure is seated in Tsai's classic Zen meditation posture, and the personalities can be witty, serious, eccentric, etc.\nYou can also see in each painting one of C. C. Tsai's personal artistic seals.",
