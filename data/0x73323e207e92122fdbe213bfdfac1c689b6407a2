  "description": "Each Mystery Trunk holds 3 Runaways who have escaped The Neverworld. Runaways have been carefully packed & hidden in trunks to protect them from Lucifer, who seeks their return. \n\nDripped in dope disguises & streetwear, every Runaway has been generated specifically for you. \n\nYou can keep your Trunk closed for as long as youâ€™d like, or open your Trunk and choose one of the three to take home. \n\nAre you bold enough to take home a Runaway? Open a Mystery Trunk and find out.  "
