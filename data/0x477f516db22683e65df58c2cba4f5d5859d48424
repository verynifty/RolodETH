  "description": "**✨ See your collection:  https://soulsgalaxy.io ✨**\n\nSOULS are interactive life forms that speak in a musical language sung by SiA.\n\nSouls express themselves through movement and sound. You can click, drag and rearrange them to your heart's content. Some enjoy interaction while others prefer none. They will let you know if they're feeling happy, sad, bored or overstimulated.\n\nDesigned by life long friends SiA and David OReilly to be a calming interactive artwork exploring the creative potential of web3. Each Soul is born with its own personality, name, voice, color pattern, rarities and ambient sound. Souls can be saved as JPGs, PNGs, GLBs, GIFs, and used as real world Augmented Reality objects in iOS. "
