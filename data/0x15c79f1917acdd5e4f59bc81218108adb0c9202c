  "description": "Knightstown is a 6969 piece collection of 130+ hand drawn traits.\r\n\r\nFree minting onto the Ethereum blockchain, the knights land in a world overrun by goblins and other filthy creatures.\r\nOur ranks of knights have the responsibility of ridding thy land of the insurrection caused by the goblins, and their fury knows no bounds. \r\n\r\nCollateral damage abound, all foul beings must be on alert. The flames of the knights' watch spread with haste."
