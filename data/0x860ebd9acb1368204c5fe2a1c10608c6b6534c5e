  "description": "The Enigmatic Box is the first advanced on-chain loot box on Ethereum. Join the [OnChainBirds](https://opensea.io/collection/onchainbirds) in the gamified upgrading process and collect multiple tiers of boxes that yield a unique on-chain collection. All upgradable boxes can be found in our [infographic](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037115727582351410/1038604506499395685/box-tiers.png).\n\nEnigmatic Boxes are 100% on-chain and will exist and retain its functionality as long as Ethereum does. Generating the collection on-chain right at opening the box ensures fair chances of rarity down to the very last box. You can open it as soon as it's possible or decades from now. Making it a true collectible."
