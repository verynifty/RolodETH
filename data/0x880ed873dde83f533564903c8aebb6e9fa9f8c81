  "description": "A music venue by night and a community-run creative space by day, BRICK will serve as an artistic and educational hub for our members. BRICK will host an eclectic variety of events: live music concerts, comedy shows, screen-printing workshops, even financial literacy and crypto security classes brought to you by Ledger, and many more to be announced.\r\n\r\nHolders of the NFTs get voting rights over what BRICK will do with the venue, as well as free entry to all events with a plus-one. BRICK is set to host a concert once a month, each coming along with a unique concert t-shirt and poster designed in collaboration with a selected artist. BRICK holders get first access to all shows and custom-designed merchandise.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't live in Los Angeles, BRICK will be buying land in the metaverse and streaming all concerts and classes there. Digital merchandise will also be created and airdropped to holders each time BRICK hosts an event.",
