  "description": "**Broken is beautiful.** — Evoking inspiration from the Japanese art of Kintsugi this avant-garde collection subverts expectations, examining the relationship between self and ambition, wholeness, strength and the false value of acquiring precious metals.\n\nKintsugi is our genesis collection and a technical test to prove our approach for on-chain generative artwork. Owning a Kintsugi directly supports our platform and acts as an early mint pass for future collections.\n\nKintsugi renders between 5,000-20,000 particles in a particle simulation, each particle simulated for four hundred frames, to produce the kintsugi lines.\n\nIt also renders 40,000-120,000 polygons for the watercolors and uses random number generation, trigonometry, and noise functions.\n\nAll of this to produce a 1024x1024 pixel image, without the aid of a GPU, using only the Ethereum blockchain."
