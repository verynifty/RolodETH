  "description": "Web3 Name Service (WNS) domains are your username for the Web3 world. WNS names provide a way to map names/numbers to your Ethereum wallet address and act as the representation of your account. \r\n\r\nWNS domains can be bought and sold on secondary markets and may be migrated to other extensions supported by us. (For example, abcd.bayc can be migrated to abcd.punk if you hold a token from the collection).\r\n\r\nRegister your new username here : https://wnsdomains.io/\r\n\r\nNote : Refresh the metadata of your WNS name on Opensea after you migrate the extension.",
