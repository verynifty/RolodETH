  "description": "https://zenft.xyz/seedling\n\nThe storytellers of the Forest Spirits have kept the history of their civilization since its beginning. Written in books in the library, or spoken around the campfire at night, they tell of a time when the first Forest Spirits were born. An event eons ago known as the 'Void Convergence' changed the world forever, and gave life to the forest.\n\nA few trees began to produce seeds, imbued with a living spirit, and dropped them on the forest floor. These were the first Forest Spirits, children of the trees. Their tree - parents became highly revered idols, and were protected like life itself. Although the trees no longer seed Forest Spirits, these ancient life - givers have been kept alive for thousands of years through the art of bonsai.\n\nA few living Forest Spirits still hold their ancestral trees within their household, a mirror image of themselves. This ancestral bond is a living history of their culture."
