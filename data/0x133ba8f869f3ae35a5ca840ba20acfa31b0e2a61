  "description": "At the top of Mt. Olympus grow the fungi of the gods: MUSHROHMS\r\n\r\nMeditating in infinite ohming bliss, these enlightened creatures will one day reach down from the mountaintop to change the consciousness of this world and beyond!\r\n\r\nJoin the movement by becoming a Shrohmie and participating in future Mushrohm events like cross-chain sporedrops, collaborations, community POAPs, and more!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: All 1st Gen Mushrohms will soon be able to enter the reversible Transmutation Bridge to the Arbitrum Network. On Arbitrum, you will have the same Mushrohm in pixel form, and will be able to participate in the TreasureDAO ecosystem at the Mothershrohm. Soon to list on Trove Marketplace. The mycelial network is spreading!\r\n\r\nTo participate and learn more, join the Mushrohms Guild in our discord: https://discord.gg/zNyyPK5Tnq"
