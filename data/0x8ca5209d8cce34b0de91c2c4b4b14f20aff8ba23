  "description": "Al Cabones, a network of organized crime groups based in the blockchain. The collection consists of 10,000 wanted skeleton mobsters each carrying their own history of ruthless crime. Following their escape, they chose to enter and hide away in the blockchain where they plan to create even more chaos. It’s about time the Metaverse is supplied with narcotics, right?"
