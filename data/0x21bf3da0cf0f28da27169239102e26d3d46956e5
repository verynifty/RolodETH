  "description": "Monaco Planet, the next-generation SocialFi platform, issues 10,000 Yacht NFTs at Monaconft.io.  \n\nUnlike other avatar-based NFTs, Yacht NFTs are the first NFTs supported and empowered by a crypto native platform.  \n\nFor genesis users of Monaco SocialFi platform, NFT holders will be the initial beneficiaries of 'content-mining'. \n\nMonaco Planet functions as a true DAO, governed and owned by the community. \n \nLife is full of challenges but, for the citizens of the Planet Monaco metaverse, life is like a dream with your own private yacht to sail off into the sunset."
