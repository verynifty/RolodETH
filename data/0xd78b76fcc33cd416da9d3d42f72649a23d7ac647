  "description": "Edgar Plans is coming to the metaverse! The Spanish contemporary artist has been designing a collection of 7,777 pieces to reflect his work of the past decade. Meet Lil’ Heroes, the mouse-eared mischievous characters dressed in a huge variety of unique hand-drawn attributes.\r\n\r\nEdgar Plans (born 1977 in Madrid) is a spanish contemporary visual artist. Painter from a very young age, he delivers pure artistic expression in childlike art pieces. His vivid and raw cartoons glean elements from the works of american icons Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. Currently displayed in the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, his artworks are sought after around the world, ending up breaking records in auction houses like Christie’s."
