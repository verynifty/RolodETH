  "description": "Munko is a collaborative art project by David Choe. \r\n\r\nAll Munkos are uniquely the same; all Munkos are uniquely different. \r\n\r\nMunkos exist in both the digital and physical realms. \r\n\r\nAs a Munko, you will have access to Phase VI, a distributed, collaborative, experiential work of art which unfolds in a community of other Munkos. \r\n\r\nAfter minting the ticket, Token Holders can take the QUESTionnaire to generate their personal Munko.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit https://munko.io/.",
