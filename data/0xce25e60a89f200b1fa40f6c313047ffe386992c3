  "description": "Dotdotdots are strange cultish creatures that live inside solidity. They disguise themselves as decimals in the code and are rarely seen naturally by human eyes. They are often referred to as bugs, but their species is unknown.\r\n\r\nDotdotsdots can be minted directly from the contract using the mint function with a price of 0.05 ETH, up to a max of 5 per transaction. There will be 4360 dotdotdots initially for mint, but will increase as the all time high price of Ethereum rises, with a cap of 10,000.",
