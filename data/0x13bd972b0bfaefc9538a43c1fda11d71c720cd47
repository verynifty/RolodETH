  "description": "BoxcatPlanet is a community-driven NFT project featuring art by GuanChun. The 3000 images are all created by Guan Chun independently, and each piece has reached her artistic level. \n\nBoxcatPlanet is more than just an NFT project, the team hopes that BoxcatPlanet will become a Web3 IP with a spirit of co-creation and exploration in the future."
