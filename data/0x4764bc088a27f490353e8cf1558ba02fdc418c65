Each collection is based on a common theme to showcase the best talent in each genre of the NFT world. \r\n\r\nOur market features both primary and secondary sales and has been widely recognized as one of the most user-friendly experiences in crypto. It is also the first project to launch on ImmutableX, the first layer 2 scaling solution focused on NFT’s. This means that trades and sales on the Kolectiv marketplace incur no gas fees and collectors still enjoy all the security and interoperability of the Ethereum network. \r\n\r\nCheck out our first collection “Crypto 2021” available now.
