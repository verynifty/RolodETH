  "description": "Moonlings are a collection of 10,000 NFTs (Non-Fungible ERC-721 Tokens) living deep within Earth’s Moon on the Ethereum blockchain. What began as a community-led project born from the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO, has evolved into far more. Brought to life by artist JuicyJama and a passionate team, Moonlings are inspired by some of our favorite Heroes & Villains."
