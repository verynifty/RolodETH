  "description": "Items found within the Forgotten Ethereal Paradigm worlds, part of the Forgotten Ethereal Worlds project.\nThese mysterious and ancient relics may be used or traded by Explorers for wealth and power.\n\nThe Paradigm Loot, will be one of the most powerful in-game items that you will not be able to find in the game itself. If you hold a Paradigm Loot alongside a Paradigm token, you will stand to reap massive benefits in the P2C idle game."
