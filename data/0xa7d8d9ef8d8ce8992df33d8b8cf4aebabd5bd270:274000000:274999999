  "description": "Isodream is a creative exploration into the interplay of form, motion, and color through the lens of isometric projection. Inspired by the unique visual appeal of depthless perspective, each Isodream seeks to spark mesmerization and joy through colorful prisms which dance about, expanding, collapsing, and orbiting together to create beautiful, playful, and thought-provoking outputs.\n\nFor artist info, output previews, exclusives for minters, and more, visit our project site at https://isodream.art\n\nControls\n--------\nReorient: Mouse Drag\nPause/Unpause: Space Bar"
