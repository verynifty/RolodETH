  "description": "**NO ROYALTIES COLLECTION!**\nENS Maxis is the first NFT collection that gives the diverse communities of ENS Domain holders a way to represent their love through their PFP and be a part of history.\nENS Maxis makes representing the Ethereum Naming Service personable and distinguishable. Sure some ENS domain names get a bit of notoriety here and there, but that's not the message the culture is here to convey. The ENS community is here to stay; we are more than just text-based domain PFPs. So, ENS Maxis was born."
