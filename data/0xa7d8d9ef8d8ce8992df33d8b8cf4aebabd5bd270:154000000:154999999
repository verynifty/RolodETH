  "description": "“Our lives are patterns of the fabric produced by the loom of time and space” (Shohaku Okumura). Looms and computers share a history of entanglement, weaving together patterns of binary code. Warp is a work of generative textiles. Modulations of form are woven to create intricate structures, stretching the metaphor of a loom. 25% of artist’s proceeds will be donated to Alianza Arkana, a grassroots alliance committed to the protection and well-being of the Peruvian Amazon and the Shipibo-Konibo peoples."
