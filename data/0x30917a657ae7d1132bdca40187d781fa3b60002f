  "description": "PxlFangs is a collection of 8888 randomly assembled pixelated Fangsters. After [Fang Runner](https://www.fanggang.io/fangrunnergame/) was released, every Fangster in the city got addicted to it. Then one day they were all sucked into the game, creating 32px versions of them called PxlFangsters.\n\nThis is a free mint collection made in collab with [pxlhns](https://opensea.io/pixelhans) for [Fang Gang](https://opensea.io/collection/fanggangnft) holders. You can find a Fangster ID checker on the [website](https://fanggang.io/pxlfangs/) to see if a Fangster can still claim a PxlFangster.\n\nPxlFangsters are originally minted in 32x32 format, and now you can upgrade them to 48x48 Super PxlFangsters by using a Super PxlChip, an item purchasable in [New Fang City](https://newfangcity.com) or on secondary market through the [Awoo Items](https://opensea.io/collection/awooitems) collection."
