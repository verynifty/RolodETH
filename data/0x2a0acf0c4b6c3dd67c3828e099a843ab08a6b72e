  "description": "An after-hours club and collection for NFT Degens. At BrokenSea we wanted to take our favorite NFT collections and break them for BrokenSea. Inspiration was Banksy-Esq Cyber/Futuristic art. \n\n This collection represents the community and what we believe NFT art would look like if Opensea were truly Broken. At BrokenseaDAO we believe in empowering and giving voice to our community. BrokenDao, BrokenBank, and $BRKN utility token play a huge factor and provide utility to all our holders. Each BrokenSea NFT grants access to the exclusive DAO community and voting rights over the DAO's assets. BrokenBank to fund future creators and collections will be set up. Blue-chip NFT giveaways for our holders will also be hosted."
