  "description": "The first thing you see is a face. Two eyes, a nose, a mouth stretched in an impossibly wide smile, showing off rows of cracked, crumbling teeth. Next you notice the skin: an acid-colored swirling pattern that looks like it would have the consistency of liquid latex, if you could only reach through the screen and touch it. In some of these pieces, whimsically demonic creatures perch in the face’s mouth and eye sockets.\r\n\r\nPsychonautz NFT consists of 9,999 unique works hand drawn by the artist Sander Jansen and is personally curated by Gabriel Santos."
