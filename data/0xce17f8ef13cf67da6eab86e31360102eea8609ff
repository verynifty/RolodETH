  "description": "Mad Meerkat is inspired by the cheeky nature of the loveable rogues, who loves nothing more than cavorting in the sun. By immortalizing 777 of these adventurous and undaunting critters on the Ethereum blockchain, we hope to introduce a symphony of emotions associated with enjoyment and recreation representing the laidback attitude of NFT collectors.\n\nEach Mad Meerkat grants you the absolute ownership of your NFT, and backs you as an entrant to the wholly owned Burrow."
