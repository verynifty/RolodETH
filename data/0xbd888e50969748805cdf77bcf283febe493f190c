  "description": "\"The M.T.A. is on a mission to explore and protect the internet’s new frontier: The Metaverse.\"\r\nWe are pioneering the next generation of wearable NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our first collection consists of 5,672 randomly assembled Metahelmets.\r\n\r\nYou’re not simply receiving a unique digital collectible. You’re gaining access to an exclusive community, filled with events, challenges, and rewards. Each Helmet is Metaverse ready, and comes with 3D files (glb) and a variety of unlockable content. Additionally, the entire collection will be optimized to be worn in Decentraland and The Sandbox, thanks to our official partnerships.\r\n\r\nTake the leap."
