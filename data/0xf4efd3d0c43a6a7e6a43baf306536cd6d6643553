  "description": "Toybirds NFT holders receive a free claim on [Toy Ape Yacht Club NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/toyapeyachtclub-nft) Claim period starts Sept 29th\n\n3,000 Toybirds are being assembled on the Ethereum Blockchain. Birbs have been transformed into toys!\n \nSome Birbs 🦉 are born pixelated, some are born toys 🔥. Toybirds is a derivative of the famed Moonbirds collection, taking pixelated Moonbirds to the next level! \n\nAnd hey ... maybe one day in the not too distant future a physical Toybird will be delivered to your address 📦\n \nToybirds is in no way affiliated with Moonbirds. It is simply a toy representation of one of our favorite NFT collections.\n"
