  "description": "Template gives token holders access to a range of interactive and generative experiences, allowing them to choose from a pool of 'Templates', that can be applied on top of the core token.\r\n\r\nDigital scarcity becomes organically driven by the decisions of all token holders.\r\n\r\nWe recommend taking a look at the FAQs in our Discord before making any purchases. This is not like any other project, so you really do need to DYOR :)",
