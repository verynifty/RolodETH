  "description": "Fidel Amos & Adam Goldman present: SHE.\n\nIn an NFT space filled with A.I.-assisted, auto-generated pieces, we wanted to give you something unique: 1,164 photo-collectibles, each individually shot and edited by hand, with the rarer pieces featuring rugs designed by Marko Nichols-Marcy, owner of Noreen Seabrook, who has done specialty rugs for Rihanna, Francis Ford Coppola, Kate Moss, and many others.\n\nAlthough SHE has a '10K pfp project vibe', we wanted each piece to be able to stand out as a true 1/1, giving as many people as possible the opportunity to own an original work of art by us."
