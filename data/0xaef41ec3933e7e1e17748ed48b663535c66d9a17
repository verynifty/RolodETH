  "description": "The Toolboxes\nThe toolboxes can be purchased with your newly acquired $BOOP tokens from the holding zone in order to start collecting tools. Once you have your toolbox, you will be able earn a boost in daily yield in the holding zone as long as you are staking your bot too. You can add up to three toolboxes per bot in the holding zone to earn more $BOOP for battle.\n\nThis is not your only use for toolboxes as they will be used for revival of passed bots from the defeat of battle to save them from the burn. But be warned, the toolbox will take the bots place in the burn as the almighty sacrifice to the AI. Although there are many types of toolboxes, the yield remains the same for each. They will cost 4,000 $boop and have a limited supply, so make sure to stock up while you can."
