  "description": "Lost for centuries â€” Atlantis has been raised from the depths and restored as a breathtaking Ethereum based collection with fully hand-draw NFTs with incredible details.  \n      \n- 3 different characters models inside of single collection.\n     \n- When the project initially launched in May 2022, those who staked their NFTs for 19 days were eligible to receive an Atlantean Parcel Pass. 1 Legends Of Atlantis NFT = 1 Atlantean Parcel Pass (the parcel pass was essentially your own land in the NFT Worlds metaverse that was to be completely separate from the main Legends of Atlantis NFT; unfortunately, Minecraft no longer allows third parties like NFT Worlds to be a part of their ecosystem and in the future there may be utility for the Atlantean Parcel Passes.).\n                               \n- Holders count is displayed incorrectly due to staking."
