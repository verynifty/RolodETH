  "description": "Tragicomedy novel, a parody of modern gallant life, in the manner of medieval times. The plot of \"Royal Fools\" is based on the adventures of a troupe of itinerant artists performing in the provincial towns of the XIV century Europe. All characters and events are fictitious, any resemblances are coincidental... Or are they?"
