  "description": "Welcome to Little Ape World, where tiny primates from all walks of life rule an exclusive rainforest in a quiet little corner of the ever-growing metaverse.\n\nWith no rules except the ones they make, the Little Apes seek to build a society that reflects their values in the virtual and real world alike. Together, they will make their mark on the metaverse and, together, they will share in the utilities they create for one another.\n\nEvery member is represented by an exclusive Little Ape NFT, each of which are hand-drawn by our partnered artist. With a unique art style, Little Ape NFTs represent good vibes and individuality to all who encounter them.\n\nSome might be nice, some might be sneaky (within reason)… Either way, we celebrate their personalities as valued members of the Little Ape World community!"
