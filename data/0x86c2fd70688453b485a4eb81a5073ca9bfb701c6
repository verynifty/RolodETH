  "description": "**WHAT?**\n\nFirst set of **5888** pixel art profile pictures. Followed up with **888** AI cities and **88** Unique Art presented as three distinct collections. \n\nVideo #1 (Pixel Art): https://bit.ly/3PKjZ3g\n\n**WTF?**\n\nSocial commentary and sarcastic take on the punk derivatives, the AI art and the narrative tied to regimes or countries buying (or selling). The art features women, bitcoin, miners, ethereum amongst dozens of other traits not found in other collections. \n\n**WHY?**\n\nWe got tired of overnight derivatives that had just stopped trying. These collections are a statement to the absurdity of it all. \nWhat if \"The China\" was better? We celebrate China, its people, its culture. No offense intended. \n\n**CHINA!**\n\n*The China!* brand will evolve into two more collections of **888** & **88** with ownership transferred to holders. \n\nVisit our website for more information.\n\n**https://TheChinaNFT.com**",
