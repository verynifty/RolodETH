  "description": "**MINTING** https://thebeecollab.io\n\n\"We aren't anti-social... We're anti-low vibing energy, anti-fakeness, and anti-bullshit.\"\n\nWe are The Bee Collab and we are building an IRL Bee Apiary Live on stream, so that you can bee right there with us behind the scenes!\n\n1/3rd of the Bees worldwide are dying every year and we need more people involved to help make a difference, so that's why we are Saving the Bees with NFTs!\n\nWhen you mint from our NFT collection, we'll be going on an Adventure together to build a real world business, producing honey and renting out Beehives to Farmlands. The business will add liquidity to our $TWEFamily Token, which is how you'll earn royalties!\n\nWhen you mint 5 of our NFTs, you'll have the option to put your Artwork on one of our IRL Beehives! *Great if you have a business or project that you want advertised*",
