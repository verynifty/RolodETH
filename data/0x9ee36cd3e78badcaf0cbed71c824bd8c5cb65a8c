  "description": "[Rarity](https://earclubnft.com/rarity) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/earc) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EARClubNFT) | [Bingo Cards](https://opensea.io/collection/earc-bingocards) | [Honoraries](https://opensea.io/collection/earc-honorary) \n\nThe ELDERLY APE RETIREMENT CLUB is a collection of 5,000 Elderly Apes living out the rest of their years in their Retirement Villa. With the overwhelming success that the apes have faced, they've decided to slow down and enjoy what life has to offer. Whether it be their daily bingo games, shuffle board, or waiting for their grandkids to call, there is never a dull moment in the Elderly Ape Retirement Club.\n\nA part of the proceeds from the sales of Elderly Apes will be donated to Alzheimer's foundations and to explore long-term partnerships."
