  "description": "IMPORTANT:\n\n** Please use a computer and headphones for the best experience \n\nTo check the number of records used up to mint songs, visit https://0xmusic.com/ and enter the token ID of the NFT and hit 'Find 0xDJ'. The number of records used to mint songs is displayed in the 'Traits' table.\n\nThis is the genesis collection from 0xmusic. Each NFT is a DJ (0xDJ) that creates a new song algorithmically in real-time every time you hit play. Once a song is played, it's destroyed forever. Each NFT can create new songs for trillions of years. Collectors also have access to MIDI files for any of the trillions of songs that their NFT can compose. Also, collectors can mint their favorite songs into their own separate NFTs using 'records' that are embedded into each NFT. All the song mints and MIDI creations are eligible to be included in the 0xmusic genesis album - The masterpiece that is both created and curated by the 0xmusic community. Visit https://0xmusic.com/ for more information. "
