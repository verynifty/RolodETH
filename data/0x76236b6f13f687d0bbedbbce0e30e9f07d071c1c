  "description": "The Pro Crypto Early Adopter NFT is the key to the Real Vision Web3 Universe. Pro Crypto is more than just an institutional-grade crypto membership — it’s a vibrant, pioneering community of investors and thinkers. To create this collection, Real Vision took the uncommon approach of building and designing it with the community every step of the way. Holders of this utility-focused NFT are given special status within the Pro Crypto community and receive a host of unique benefits and experiences. The size of this collection will never be increased and is strictly limited to 6,000 NFTs. This NFT collection was built in-house by Real Vision and designed by the Pro Crypto community.\n\nMore Info:\n\n- [Pro Crypto NFT Overview](https://www.realvision.com/pro-crypto-nft)\n- [Pro Crypto Important Updates](https://www.realvision.com/pro-crypto-updates)\n",
