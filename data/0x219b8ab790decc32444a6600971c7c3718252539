  "description": "We have recently changed to passive staking - so until all Vampires are unstaked, holder count is incorrect.\n\n[Website](https://svs.gg) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/SVSNFT) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SVSNFT) | [IG](https://instagram.com/sneakyvampiresyndicate) | [Sneaky Vampiress Syndicate](https://opensea.io/collection/sneaky-vampiress-syndicate) | [Sneaky Bat Syndicate](https://opensea.io/collection/sneaky-bat-syndicate)\n\nThe Sneaky Vampire Syndicate consists of 8,888 Vampires living their best life in The Lair - away from any burning sunlight or pesky Vampire Hunters. The Syndicate is known for its community, as they are staked to accrue their $BLOOD Tokens! Their furry friends in the form of Bat Companions never leave their side.\n\nAll Vampire holders gain access to join SVS Alpha – the best for upcoming projects, along with the ability to mint a Pixel Version of their Vampire! Other $BLOOD Utility awaits, including Private Label Champagne, 3D Models and The Blood Pact!"
