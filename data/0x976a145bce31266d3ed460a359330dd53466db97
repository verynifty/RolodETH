  "description": "The Kiss is a 1024-piece art collection generated entirely by the smart-contract code, by divergence (the team behind [Brotchain](https://opensea.io/collection/brotchain) and [PROOF OF {ART}WORK](https://opensea.io/collection/proof-of-artwork)) & Etheseus.\n\nUnlike most NFT images, which need to be hosted (eg on IPFS), everything you see here is a direct output of the smart contract.\n\nThe Kiss is based on the Apollonian Gasket, one of the oldest problems in geometry. This implementation takes the original and makes it infinitely more complex by using the Ethereum programming language, Solidity—which has nothing but whole numbers, simple math operations (+-×÷) and a few logical functions. As a result, this collection is as intricate and elegant on the inside as it is to look at.\n\n[Renderer contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD119E58b5761932A39C0D15103539b5DfEc23865#code) | [Learn more](https://thekiss.xyz)"
