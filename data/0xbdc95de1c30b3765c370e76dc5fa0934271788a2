  "description": "IMPORTANT NOTES: Series 2 is still minting here: https://dumpsterdorks.com/ -- Holder/supply count is not accurate due to a contract migration: there are ~1900 S2 Dorks that can still be minted (as of 10/19/22) -- also due to the contract migration your newly minted S2 Dorks may be sent automatically to your HIDDEN folder!  Thank you for understanding.\n\nDumpsterDorks Series 2 is an NFT collection of 7,500 randomly generated avatars stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Spawned from over 750 of the sickest hand-drawn 80s and 90s elements. Score some trash worth treasuring! This is Series 2. Series 1 can be found at the link below.\n\n[DumpsterDorks](https://opensea.io/collection/dumpsterdorks)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Collabs](https://opensea.io/collection/dumpster-dorks-collabs)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Slimeballs](https://opensea.io/collection/ddslimeballs)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Website](https://www.dumpsterdorks.com)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zAstZNb5Ab)\n",
