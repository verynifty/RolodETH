  "description": "Mundane Bunz is a collection of 4,888 of the cutest yet mundane looking bunniez waiting to be adopted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEach feature is meticulously hand drawn by our artist and then programmatically generated.\n\nEvery single Mundane Bunz will be unique. Some of them are even so unique they are drawn individually and have parts no other mundanebunz will have.\n\n"
