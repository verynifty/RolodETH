  "description": "Game of Silks is a next-generation fantasy sports game that promotes collaboration between racehorse owners, horse farms, and land developers to optimize valuable rewards and offset risk in the high-stakes world of thoroughbred horseracing.\n\n**Each year 20,000 thoroughbred racehorses are born in the U.S. and compete annually for over $1,000,000,000 in prize money.**\n\nSilks tokenizes each IRL racehorse into a collectable digital in-game asset when they turn one year old. Each Silks racehorse represents an actual IRL racehorse and tracks its training, racing, and breeding performance throughout its life.  Owning a Silk racehorse is like drafting a fantasy football player except you actually own the ‘player’ for its entire 20+ year life.  You can create a syndicate to share its ownership with others, stable your horse in a farm to pool your winnings with other horses, and sell it at any time.  **You win valuable prizes every time the underlying IRL horse wins races and breeds.**\n",
