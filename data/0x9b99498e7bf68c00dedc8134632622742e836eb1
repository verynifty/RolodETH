  "description": "The First Ghosties are the first inhabitants of Earth since it became a barren wasteland. Being a First Ghostie grants you exclusive access to everything Ghostie, from in-game content to early access builds and more. \n\nGhostie: Battle for the Bones creates a brand new game genre, combining fighting games with MOBA jungling elements. In development by Test Jar Labs, a venture backed game studio founded by USC Games alumni. "
