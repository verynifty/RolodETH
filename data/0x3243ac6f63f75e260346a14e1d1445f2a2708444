  "description": "Babies are your intergalactic sidekicks traveling through Coolman's Universe. One collection, two very different sides. Spesh Babies are on a mission to help save the universe, while some babies have lost their way, under the control of Anti Spesh and his promise of a decent hourly wage. The fate of the universe hangs in the balance and it's up to Spesh and the Babies to save us all. \n\nA project by Coolman Coffeedan aka Danny Casale 💕\n\n[Official Website](https://coolmansuniverse.com/) |\n\n[Coolman's Universe NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/coolmans-universe) |\n\n[JAR DUDE](https://opensea.io/collection/coolmans-universe-jar-dude) |\n\n[Coolman's Collectibles](https://opensea.io/collection/coolmans-collectibles) |"
