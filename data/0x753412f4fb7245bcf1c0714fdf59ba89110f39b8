  "description": "Many Keys are Forged (or staked). Most sales are private (not OpenSea).\n\nLiquid Keys from [ApeLiquid.io](https://ApeLiquid.io) unlock the Liquid Forge and the Mythic Gateway, which allows the holder to evolve a Mythic Creature by sacrificing a Liquid Legend, Liquid Invader, Azuki Ape Social Club, or Typical Tiger Tiger + Baby Cub, and by burning a Liquid Artifact to activate the Mythic Gateway and evolution process.\n\nKeys listed at 1 ETH or lower will be \"re-rolled\" with new properties. Listing at 1 ETH or lower is risky and not advised.",
