  "description": "From why it was created to how, there are so many reason why, \"When Two Stars Collide,\" is such an important piece of work to me. This photo was inspired by love, created with love and is meant to represent what it feels like to be in love. When I envisioned this photo I had no plans on setting up a shoot. I would tell myself, \"It'll happen when the time is right\". One day at the beach, I approached a couple who looked so smitten for each other. They agreed to the shoot and we got in the water. I told them to kiss, and in that moment my whole vision came to life. The photo I kept seeing in my head was finally locked in on my roll of Portra 800, I just had to develop it. After it released in 2021,  it touched so many people, it felt like my biggest accomplishment as a photographer. When I turned this piece into a 1/1, there was a lot of ego tied to it. I told myself this piece HAD to sell as a 1/1. So to challenged my ego, I burned the 1/1 and turned my favorite photo into an edition."
