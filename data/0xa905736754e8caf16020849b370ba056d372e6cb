  "description": "REVEAL ON JANUARY 14TH\nLazy Tiger Wood Club is a collection of 5,000 unique, randomly generated Tiger Humanoids adventuring on the Ethereum blockchain. Every LTWC NFT is unique and made from over 80+ possible attributes and traits. They can have different backgrounds, skins, clothes, facial expressions, accessories, and headgear. They are all made with love, but some are rarer than others.\n\nWhen you buy an LTWC NFT, you not only own a cool .JPEG, but you also get access to our great events, own the commercial rights, and automatically participate in our monthly giveaways. A good reason not to just take a screenshot!\n\n5,000 Humanoid Tigers\nFirst Mint 7-1-22\nSecond Mint 28-1-22",
