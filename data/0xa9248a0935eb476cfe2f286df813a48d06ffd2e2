  "description": "[**NOTE : Opensea sales DO NOT include any additional TEARS.**](https://opensea.io/collection/drp-vhils-layers-tears)\r\n\r\nDeveloped by gallery-led platform DRP.io, LAYERS by Vhils is the first evolutionary NFT project in which collectors can co-create blue chip artworks through interacting with tokens on-chain. Each NFT is revealed layer-by-layer through holders choosing how to [\"tear\"](https://opensea.io/collection/drp-vhils-layers-tears) their pieces.\r\n\r\nHow you tear your LAYER also determines your collector journey as part of Vhilsâ€™ collector community and your access to his calendar of exclusive art projects, on and off chain. Through staking, burning and merging NFTs at various stages of reveal, LAYERS can be converted into physical artworks, NFTs and experiences.",
