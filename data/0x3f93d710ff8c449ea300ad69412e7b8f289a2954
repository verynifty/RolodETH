  "description": "A community-driven collectibles project featuring art by Amber Park and Mason Rothschild. Across the 10,000 Weirdos in our collection, no two are the same - much like humankind itself. Consider every Weirdo minted representative of that holder’s inner Weirdo, a cosmic embodiment of our one-of-a-kind oddities."
