  "description": "About KPOP CTzen Official\n\nListening to music is one of the activities that people around the world do in common.\n\nListening to the music itself is a connection and empathy.\nBut at the same time, listening to music also means disconnection and isolation.\nAs a human being who transcends the borders, and as a citizen of a metaverse, we can go ahead towards the future when we listen to music, recommend, empathize, sympathize, inspire, and have fun.\n\nIn K-POP City, you can meet your favorite K-POP star and interact with them.\n\nFurthermore, with the KPOP CTzens who form a musical empathy with you, you can make a group, start a project, and go on a journey to KPOP star, and even a global star.\n\nWould you like to listen to music with us?",
