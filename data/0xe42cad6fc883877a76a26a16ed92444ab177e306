  "description": "The Merge is a massive technological milestone bringing sustainability, security, and scalability to Ethereum. To celebrate this important moment, ConsenSys commissioned a series of works depicting detailed worlds embodying these concepts.\n\nThe collection, called Regenesis, comes in different editions including an open edition focused on the most important benefit of the Merge: sustainability. The art explores the scale and significance of the Merge, an ambitious re-architecture of the world’s largest open programmable blockchain, which makes the network 2000x more energy efficient and positions Ethereum to sustainably support the next generation of Web3 creators and developers.
