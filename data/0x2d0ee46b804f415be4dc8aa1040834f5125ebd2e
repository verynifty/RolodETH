  "description": "Dapper Dinos are a collection of 9,999 randomly generated dinosaurs roaming the Ethereum Blockchain. Dapper Dinos was founded with the idea of being a family-friendly, kid-loveable, hyper-collectible, and fun to look at collection of Dinosaur NFTs! This project was started to give back to our kids and the mantra of charity and community is woven through the project.\n\nIf you are looking for the brave 555 dinos that sacrificed themselves and were reborn with custom backgrounds from influential artists, please visit the [Dapper Dinos: Karma Collective](https://opensea.io/collection/ddkc)"
