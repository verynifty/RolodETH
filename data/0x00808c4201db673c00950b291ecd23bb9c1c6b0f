  "description": "Turf objects are awesome collectibles that we release to our community through a bunch of different mechanisms. Sometimes it will be via our free gifty minting program or the shops on plots. All objects are limited release, once they are minted they aren't minted again.\n\nOfficial Links [Turf.dev](https://www.turf.dev) :: [Turf Discord](https://www.discord.gg/invite/turf)  :: [Turf Plots](https://opensea.io/collection/turfnft) :: [OG Turf Objects](https://opensea.io/collection/turfobjects)",
