  "description": "Cascade by TinkRNG is a novel, biologically-inspired generative art project portraying patterns in the human proteome. Each piece represents a unique protein, with properties derived from information including the protein’s amino acid sequence, the cellular compartment where the protein localizes to, and the primary biological process that the protein is involved in.\n\nTo learn more, please read our [White Paper](https://medium.com/@tinkrng/cascade-by-tinkrng-6f20bccfbf1d) as well as our [second publication](https://medium.com/@tinkrng/chalk-talk-exploring-the-biological-processes-that-underly-cascade-by-tinkrng-d87337004ba8). \n\nOur Cascade Genesis collection can be found on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/cascade-genesis-by-tinkrng) as well as [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@tinkRNG) where it was originally auctioned.
