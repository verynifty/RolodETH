  "description": "CLOUDMACHINE is an art focused collection handcrafted by Dave Van Patten. We are a small group of friends and family that are headquartered in Long Beach, California. Our shared passion for nostalgia, music and all things odd, has not only allowed us to introduce a carefully crafted genesis collection but also hand picked physical offerings available to our holders.\r\n \r\nOur primary goal is to create various ways for collectors to bridge the gap between the physical and the digital. Given our core belief of connecting Web3 culture to IRL events we have partnered with CAMEO PASS as our launch partner and development team. CAMEO PASS’s primary collection features original artwork by Burnt Toast, Vinnie Hager, and Luke McGarry. Besides bringing the utility of various IRL events for their holders, CAMEO PASS released Daydreamers for their recent successful release, as well as Luke Mcgarry‘s art focused Genesis collection."
