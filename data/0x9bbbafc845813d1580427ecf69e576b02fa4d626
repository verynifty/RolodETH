  "description": "Wonder Secret Club is a art-based project born from the fusion of a nostalgic worldview and web3.\n\nThe story is about a group of children who are good friends and take on various mysterious incidents that occur in the fictional town of Fortville (FORTVILL). The emphasis is on the story and setting, including nostalgic and mysterious developments.\n\nThe WSC collection features 2,000 unique characters, all of whom are grayscale in order to express a retro and nostalgic worldview, in direct contrast to the colorful and eccentric art that is mainstream in the nft space.
