The avatars can then be hacked by the collectors, customized, disassembled and assembled on the [dedicated website](http://queenskings.hackatao.com) builder. In the cryptoverse, a non-hierarchical community is in charge, traditional roles of the art world are subverted.  Hack the Royals, let the Self-Crowning begin.  ",
