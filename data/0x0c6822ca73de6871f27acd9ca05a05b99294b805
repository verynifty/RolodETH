  "description": "During our burning event, every two OG Miners (our 1st collection) that were burned, created one Ultra Miner. After 80% or 8,890 OG Miners were burned in total, 4,445 Ultra Miners were created and were packed with double the utility! Ultras consist of brand new hand-drawn traits and started the generation of our HASH Token. The HASH token will now be utilized in a number of ways through our website and on our newest platform and game, Mission to Mars. \nThe Ultra Miners are the utility power house of BMC and generate the MOST HASH Token out of all our collections (through staking).\n\nUltra Miners Staked: 2,313/4,445 (52%)\n\nOther Collections:\nBMC OG Miners: https://opensea.io/collection/blockchainminersclubofficial\nBMC HASH Droids: https://opensea.io/collection/bmc-hashdroid\nBMC Rocket Pass: https://opensea.io/collection/bmc-rocket-pass\nOG Blockchain Miner Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/blockchainminersclubofficial",
