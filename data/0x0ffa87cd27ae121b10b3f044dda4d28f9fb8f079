  "description": "SIDUS NFT Heroes is the original NFT collection featured in the SIDUS HEROES metaverse. The collection includes 6,000 generative characters created by NFT STARS and the international collective of modern artists NFT256.\n\nThe SIDUS NFT Heroes collection serves as an entry ticket to the SIDUS HEROES metaverse. You can lock your card on the SIDUS HEROES website and immediately receive a Hero, which will be released inside the game. Depending on the rarity of the Original NFT Hero, you will receive a Common, Epic or Legendary Hero in the game. \nAfter the lock period is over, you will get your card back and you can lock it again, if you wish, for another period and receive a new Hero inside the game.\n",
