  "description": "CryptoSkulls Alchemy Lab is a collection of 10,000 Demonic Blood Vials NFTs that would allow all OG CryptoSkulls owners to Demonize their skulls into the Demonic Skulls, therefore expanding the original collection and Skullish Community.\n\nBe careful with your Demonic Blood as every vial has been filled by Alchemist himself and can result in truly demonic transformations.\n\nFor more info visit [DemonicSkulls.com](https://demonicskulls.com/)"
