  "description": "Roaring Leaders is a unique deflationary collection of generative NFTs on the ethereum blockchain designed by [Carlos Dattoli](https://www.instagram.com/carlosdattoliart/), a Marvel artist.\n\nOriginally, there were 10,000 Roaring Leaders and ~1,755 were burned due to our deflationary mechanism. Our supply is now at 8,245 Roaring Leaders, enhancing the value and rarity of the overall collection. *Number of holders does not reflect accurately due to staking.*\n\nAlso, checkout our [Genesis collection](https://opensea.io/collection/genesis-roaring-leaders) and our [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/roaringleaders)",
