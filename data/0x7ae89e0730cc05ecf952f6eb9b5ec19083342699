DarkElfs are stylistically curated NFTs that exist on the Ethereum Blockchain. Each DarkElf doubles as a community pass to [Discord](https://discord.gg/vZ64DvkUzb) , IRL Events and gives each holder the opportunity to be a part of building the DarkElf MetaVerse. \n\nOur race has now been saved, except for master Do'rak. You have helped us reach fertile lands from cursed ones, and for this we are eternally grateful. Now, our army is stronger than ever! We are preparing to embark on a new and challenging journey with our commanders, knights and ring-bearers. Our wizards and witches are working day and night to create the elixir. We must all drink from the elixir to be fully prepared for war! You will be joining us on the frontlines of this war. \n\nGet live updates on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DarkElfNft) and on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vZ64DvkUzb)"
