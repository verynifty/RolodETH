  "description": "DRIVE is an NFT Photography Collection from Dave Krugman, featuring 111 1/1 vehicles, aggregated over the course of ten years of street photography. But this project is more than just a collection- it is an ecosystem of access, a dynamic community game, and an entry ticket to a wide range of future endeavors.\r\n\r\nMinted on a @manifoldxyz contract, DRIVE is broken down into the following categories.\r\n\r\nThere are 20 Trophies, representing the most rarefied visuals. Aliens, classic restorations, and strange designs abound. To win a Trophy, you must own a car, and enter it into a race event.\r\n\r\nThere will be various race events and mechanics, gamified via social media. \r\n\r\nThere are 8 Grails up for a 24 HR Auction. \r\n\r\nTier 1- 25 cars at .5 ETH\r\nTier 2- 33 cars at .33 ETH\r\nTier 3- 25 cars at .25 ETH\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of visual rarities spread throughout ALL Tiers of the collections. Some cars have qualities that are entirely unique. I wonâ€™t spoil those secrets, it is up to the community to determine.",
