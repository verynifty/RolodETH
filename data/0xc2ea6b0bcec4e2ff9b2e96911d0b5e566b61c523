  "description": "Complicit, photographs of older men, is about the existential reality all humans face. \n\nIn 2010, my grandmother died. It was a difficult time for my family. \n\nSo I started making portraits of older men to learn about aging. \n\nIn contemporary culture, there is almost no representation of older people, even less older gay people. For 5 years, from 2010 - 2018, I sought out, photographed, and maintained relationships with older men in an effort to learn how to age without bitterness or fear.\n\nComplicit collection was originally listed on an Opensea ERC-1155 smart contract on November 16, 2021. As of April 27, 2022, the project has a trading volume of 13.4ETH. \n\nThe collection was updated to the current Complicit ERC-721 smart contract on April 28, 2022. Any additional trading volume must also take into account the initial trading volume of 13.4 ETH. ",
